# ArduinoSubCounter

## Description
This project is based on TheSwedishMaker's "This is The 20$ Subscriber Counter - Youtube & Instagram" project with some modifications to update Instagram's API calls and replace Youtube's integration with Facebook instead.

The objective of this project is to create a display that integrates Arduino with some API calls that shows how many Followers and Likes a certain user has on Instagram and Facebook.
